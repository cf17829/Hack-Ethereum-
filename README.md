# Libraries Used:  
The script uses the requests, time, eth_account, and mnemonic libraries.

# Mnemonic Generation: 
It generates a random mnemonic phrase using the BIP39 word list, which is commonly used for generating mnemonic phrases for cryptocurrency wallets.

# Address Generation:
Using the generated mnemonic, the script derives Ethereum addresses and their corresponding private keys.

# Balance Checking: 
It then checks the balance of each generated Ethereum address using the Etherscan API. If the address has a non-zero balance, it records the address, mnemonic, and balance.

# Error Handling: 
The script includes error handling to ensure that if an error occurs during the process, it will save any addresses with non-zero balances that were discovered before the error occurred.

# Output: 
The script prints information about each generated Ethereum address, including the address itself, the mnemonic phrase used to generate it, and its balance (if any). Additionally, it saves information about addresses with non-zero balances to a text file named "addresses_with_balance.txt".

Overall, the script automates the process of generating Ethereum addresses, checking their balances, and saving information about addresses with non-zero balances for further analysis or use.
